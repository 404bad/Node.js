Basic working of Node js

request -----> event loop ----> check if it is a blocking operation or not 

if it is a non blocking operation(async) then the request is processed and response is passed to the client
and if it is blocing operation(synchronous) then the request is pased to the thred pool

in the thread pool only 4 thread (worker) are. there by deafault and the number of thread is always limited
max number of thread are dependable upon the system
for exmple a 8 core cpu can have  8 threads

the thread process the blocking operations and the response is passed to the client
