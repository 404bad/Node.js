REST is an architectural style, not a protocol.
It defines a set of rules and constraints for building web APIs.

REST → Representational State Transfer

A RESTful API is an API that follows REST architectural principles to enable communication between independent client and server systems using HTTP.

If a server follows these REST rules, we say that the server provides a RESTful API.

Client (Browser, Mobile App, Alexa, etc.)
            ⬇ Request
Server
            ⬆ Response


1. The client sends a request to the server
2. The server processes the request
3. The server sends a response back to the client

## RESTful API Rules (Key Principles)

For this communication, some standards / best practices must be followed.
These standards are defined by REST architecture.

A RESTful API is based on client–server architecture, which means:

-- The client and server are independent systems
-- The client only cares about the response
-- The server only cares about processing the request
-- Either side can change without affecting the other, as long as the API contract remains the same


#3 Important REST Constraints

A RESTful API usually follows these rules:

1. Client–Server Architecture
2. Stateless (server does not store client session data)
3. Uses HTTP methods
   --  GET → read
   --  POST → create
   --  PUT / PATCH → update
   --  DELETE → delete
4. Uses URLs to represent resources
    -- /users
5. Uses standard HTTP status codes
    --  200 OK
    -- 201 Created
    -- 400 Bad Request
    -- 404 Not Found
    -- 500 Internal Server Error
    -- 401 Unauthorized
